    <!-- 1. typescript is typed superset of javascript that compiles to plain javascipt
         2. adds additional features like static type (optional), class, mmodule etc. to javascpt 
        
        let, var, const,
        const works for variable. to make the constant object u can use freeze method. freeze is not
        allowed in latest typescript version 
        
        let str = `hello this is typescript`;
        console.log(`output${str}`)
    
        arrow function
        var add=(a:number,b:number)=>{
            console.log(a+b);
        }
        add(1,2);
        add(aaa,bbb)// not allowed
        
        the value of this stabilizes in set time out also bcoz of fat arrow functions.
        
        const obj = {color:red};
        obj.color = "green"; // const is not working on object
    
        const obj = Object.freeze({color:red});
        obj.color = "green"; //now it shows error while changing the value of object key which is const type.
    
        data types - 
        var x:number;
        var x1:string;
        var x2:true;
        var x3:void;
        
        function fun1(x:number,y:number):number // <- return type
        {
            return x+y;
        }
    
        var list: Array<number> = [1,2,3]
        var list:number[]=[1,2,3]
        
        enum(enumaration is an labeled array)
    
        tuple:tuple types allow u to express an array where where the type of fixed numer
    
        type assertion -
        type asertion is a hint to tranpilar about the type of something 
        let value: any = "botcode technologies"
    
        class - class can have attributes and methods
                
        class Student{
            name:string="vitthal";
            rollno:number=0
            constructor(str,rno){
                this.name = str;
                this.rollno = str;
                console.log("constructor");
            }
            getName():string{
                return this.name;
            }
            setDetails
        }
        class is a template which will have variable,attributes and methods
        object is instance of class which physically exist which will have its attribute and behaviour
        consteucor is special function which will exicuted automatic which have no return type,it allowcate memory
        to abject and initializes membory.
        * in typescript we will have onle one constructor in one class
    
        access specifires
        public - it is default can be access outside of class
        private - only member function of the class it's declared in can see this
        protected - only the class is declared in and any class that inherites from that class can see this
    
        concrit class having all methods implimentation written thst is all concrit methods
        if implementation of method needs to be ommited in base class then declare that method as abstract
        (abstract method will not have implementation)
        abstract abfun();
        if a class contains atleast one abstract method class becomes abstract(abstract class will have
        abstract method and concrit method as well)
        abstract method must be implemented in derived class
        u can't create an object of abstract class
        
        interface
        interface Human{
            firstName:"vitthal";
            lastname:"patil";
            name?:Function;
            isLate?:(time:Date):Function;}
        
            implementing class must implement all methods of interfaces.

            interface shape(){

            }
            class person implements shape,I2{
                shape(){

                }
                I2(){

                }
            }
        }
    
        generics - able to create a component that can work over the variety of types rather than a single one.
        
        function identity<T>(arg:T):T{
            return arg;
        }

        ternary operator
        (a>b)?'a is greter':'a is samller';

        array distructuring to extract the data from arrays and objects
        let arr = ['red','orange','white'];
        let[val1,val2,val3] = arr;
        let[val1,,val3] = arr;
        console.log(val1) // expected outout 'red'
        console.log(val3) // expected output 'white'

        distructuring in objects
        let obj = {'hii','hello','hey'}
        let {val1,val2,val3} = obj;
        console.log(val2) // expected output hello
        let {val1='how',,val3} = obj;

        array methods
        let arr = ['red','orange','white'];
        let newarr = arr.map(ele=>ele+"s");

        let newarr2 = arr.filter(ele=>ele.startWith("o"));
        
        reduce method iterates over all the elements of an array and takes action on each iteration

        let arr = [1,2,3,4,5];
       let res = arr.reduce((sum,curent)=>sum+=curent);
       console.log(res);

       npx - node package execute. it is basically node package runner which allows to run javascript packages without
       install in it

       a package manager such as yarn or npm.it let you take advantage of a vast ecosystem of third party package 
       bable - it is webpack or parcel it will write module code and bundle together.
       webpack - webpack is static module bundler for modern js app.

       components in react - 
       building blocks
       it is reusable
       it keeps app clean and seperate
